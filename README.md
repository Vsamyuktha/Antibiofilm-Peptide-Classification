# Antibiofilm-Peptide-Classification
**Objective:** This project performs Antibiofilm Peptide Classification using a Feed Forward Neural Network built from scratch acheiving an MCC (Matthew's correlation coefficient) score of 83.87% on test data.

The **NN_Manual.ipynb** file includes the code for:

    1. Extracting features from the peptide string using kmers.
    2. Oversampling to help with the imbalance in the dataset.
    3. Building Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch.
    4. Performing L2 regularization.

The **NN_using_packages.ipynb** includes code for building the Feed Forward Neural Network using PyTorch package.

**Dataset:** The project requires train.dat and test.dat files.

Details for the experimental results and plots can be found in the report file.
